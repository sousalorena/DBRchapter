# An introduction to Design-based Research in TEL
Authors: Lorena Sousa, Luís Pedro, and Carlos Santos

## 1. Introduction

The objective of this chapter is to…: 
* … introduce Design-Based Research (DBR) as a research method, including some definitions, other terminologies, and the structure of the research question;
* … present different models for conducting DBR, their phases (analysis, development and evaluation) and characteristics;
* … suggest a repertoire of activities that may be developed in each phase. 

This chapter is organized in three main parts. In the first part, some definitions and other DBR terminologies that might be used as synonyms are presented. Also, there will be an introduction to the structure of the research question in order to help you elaborate yours. In the second part, some models for conducting DBR are introduced, as well as their phases - which are analysis, development and evaluation -, and characteristics. In the third part, a repertoire of activities that may be developed in each phase is suggested. During the chapter, you will have access to other references and be informed about further reading recommendations.  

## 2. DBR Definitions
Two possible purposes of DBR can be identified, and depending on the purpose of the research they may be distinguished between development studies and validation studies (Plomp, 2013).
* **Development studies**: to develop a research-based intervention as a solution for complex problems in educational practice. 
* **Validation studies**: to develop or validate theories about processes of learning and teaching.

However, regardless of the purpose, Plomp (2013, p.11) affirms that DBR “encompasses the systematic study of designing, developing and evaluating educational interventions”. These interventions can be programs, learning processes, learning environments, teaching-learning materials, products or systems.

The Design-Based Research Collective (2003, p.5) states that “educational research is often divorced from the problems and issues of everyday practice – a split that resulted in a credibility gap and creates a need for new research approaches that speak directly to problems of practice and that lead to the development of ‘usable knowledge’.”

Van den Akker (1999, p.2) writes “that ‘traditional’ research approaches such as experiments, surveys, correlational analyses, with their emphasis on description hardly provide prescriptions that are useful for design and development problems in education”.

Bakker (2018, p. 3) says that “most educational research describes or evaluates education as it currently is. Some educational research analyzes education as it was. Design research, however, is about education as it _could be_ or even as it _should be_.” In other words, traditional research approaches in the education field usually provide a description of the context, and rarely emphasize a plan or suggestion that is useful to tackle real problems in education.

Reeves (2006, p. 57) argues that “there is an urgent need for a better approach to educational technology research”. Instead of undertaking comparison studies, analyzing if method A is better than method B, educational technologists should conduct research aimed at developing optimal solutions to practical problems in learning environments.

### 2.1 Terminology
There are a lot of terms related to DBR. Some of them are synonyms, others may vary according to their goals and characteristics. Examples are _Design Research in Education_ or _Educational Design Research_. _Education_ and _Educational_ were incorporated in the term to denote the area in question and avoid confusion with DBR from other fields. 

In addition to these examples, other members of this family are (Plomp, 2013; Reeves, 2006):
* design experiments
* design studies
* development or developmental research 
* engineering research
* formative research 
* participatory action research 
* design-based implementation research

## 3. Research functions
Plomp (2013) affirms that, in general, various research functions can be identified and distinguished from each other, with each reflecting certain types of research questions:

* **to describe**: what is the achievement of Chinese grade 8 pupils in mathematics?; what barriers to students’ experience in the learning of mathematical modelling? 
* **to compare**: what are the differences and similarities between the Chinese and the Netherlands curriculum for primary education?; what is the achievement in mathematics of Chinese grade 8 pupils as compared to that in certain other countries? 
* **to evaluate**: how well does a program function in terms of competences of graduates?; what are the strengths and weaknesses of a certain approach? 
* **to explain or to predict**: what are the causes of poor performance in mathematics (i.e. in search of a ‘theory’ predicting a phenomenon when certain conditions or characteristics are met)? 
* **to design and develop**: what are the characteristics of an effective teaching and learning strategy aimed at acquiring certain learning outcomes?

If you are writing your research project, you must begin with a research problem or a research question. There is a logical sequence of development, let’s take a look at it:

_problem → research question → (primary) research function → choice of research design_

We already saw examples of research questions and their research function. So now you are going to see examples of research designs.

## 4. Research designs
Examples of research designs and their possible research functions are:
* _Survey_: to describe, to compare, to evaluate
* _Case studies_: to describe, to compare, to explain
* _Experiments_: to explain, to compare
* _Action research_: to design/develop a solution to a practical problem
* _Ethnography_: to describe, to explain
* _Correlational research_: to describe, to compare
* _Evaluation research_: to determine the effectiveness of a program

Textbooks on research methodology usually do not present and discuss design research, probably due to its recently emerging status and the fact that relatively small groups across several disciplines have been responsible for its development.

* _Design research_: to design and develop an intervention (such as programs, teaching-learning strategies and materials, products and systems) as a solution to a complex educational problem as well as to advance our knowledge about the characteristics of these interventions and the processes to design and develop them, or alternatively to design and develop educational interventions (about for example, learning processes, learning environments and the like) with the purpose to develop or validate theories.
 
### Reflective activity
Think of a general problem faced by practitioners in the Education and Technology-enhanced Learning field. Try to formulate a research question to this problem. Write your research question and contextualize the problem briefly. What is its research function? What is its research design? 


## 5. The overall research question in DBR
Here we have some examples of research question structures that might help you when elaborating yours, in case you are going to conduct a research using DBR as the research method.
* What are the characteristics of an intervention X for the purpose/outcome Y in context Z? (Plomp, 2013)
* What are the characteristics of an effective teaching and learning strategy aimed at acquiring certain learning outcomes in a certain context?

Examples of research questions using the structure above are:

* What are the characteristics of an intervention for promoting academic research writing which will best support graduates in education in the proposal stage of their research? (Dowse & Howie, 2013)
* What are the characteristics of micro-scale chemistry curriculum materials so that they contribute to the implementation of effective practical work in chemistry teaching in Tanzania schools? (Mafumiko, Voogt, & van den Akker, 2013)
* What are the characteristics of a digital resource for teaching and learning mathematics in secondary schools? 
* What are the characteristics of an online course aimed at enhancing second language acquisition in higher education? 

### Reflective activity
Now, if you are thinking of conducting a Design-Based Research, try to formulate your research question using the structure presented above. 

## 6. Cycles and phases
Whatever the purpose of DBR - development studies (to develop research-based solutions for complex problems in educational practice) or validation studies (to develop or validate theories about processes of learning and teaching) -, the research process always incorporates systematic educational design processes, as illustrated below:

Like all systematic educational and instructional design processes - it is cyclical or iterative. It incorporates cycles of analysis, design, evaluation and revision activities until a balance between the intended ideas and realization has been achieved. This process can be illustrated in several ways, depending on how authors have visualized it. 

Let’s see another example.

### Reeves’ model
Reeves (2006) presented a model that highlights four main phases of DBR:

The arrows represent the iterative characteristic of the process.

### McKenney’s model
This model below was the research design used by Susan McKenney in her thesis.


It has three main phases: needs & context analysis; design, development & formative evaluation; and semi-summative evaluation.

Each phase consisted of multiple cycles of activities: 

In the first micro cycle, for example, literature review and concept validation were conducted; in the second micro cycle, site visits were carried out; in the second phase, there were four micro cycles of prototype development; and then a final evaluation and a query were conducted in the third phase, representing one micro cycle each.

In total, eight micro cycles were conducted, two in the first phase, four in the second, and two in the third one.

The number of participants varied in each cycle. In the first cycle there were about 20 participants; in the second, about 50; in the third, there were almost 60, and so on.

According to the scale, each cycle lasted about six months.

### McKenney and Reeves’ model
Based on their survey and analysis of existing models and frameworks for DBR, McKenney and Reeves created the _generic model for conducting design research in education_:

This model shows the core elements of a flexible process that features the three main stages: analysis/exploration, design/construction, and evaluation/reflection. 

The three stages take place in interaction with implementation and spread, and this model provides the dual outputs of intervention and theoretical understanding.

### Summary
Authors may vary in the details of how they portray DBR, but they all agree that DBR consists of three main phases: preliminary research, development or prototyping phase, and assessment phase (Plomp, 2013).


* **Preliminary research** consists of needs and context analysis, review of the literature and of projects addressing questions similar to the ones in your study, and development of a conceptual framework.
* The **development or prototyping phase** consists of an iterative process where prototypes are going to be tried out and revised on the basis of formative evaluations. It aims at improving and refining the intervention. 
* In the **assessment phase**, a semi-summative evaluation is carried out to conclude whether the solution meets the predetermined specifications and whether it is effective. It often results in recommendations for improving the intervention, that is why this evaluation is called semi-summative.
*Throughout all these activities, the researcher conducts a **systematic reflection and documentation** to produce the theories as the scientific result of the research, besides the intervention that is more practical.
